# Rendered
Rendered is a lightweight Minecraft Java library that uses display entities to create edges from Location a to Location b. These edges can be used to create anything.

Currently, the library has built in support for creating Two Shapes:
- A Cuboid which requires: Location cornerOne, and Location cornerTwo
- A Sphere which requires: Location center, double radius, int segments
